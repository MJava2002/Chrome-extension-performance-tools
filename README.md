# Tested features, libraries and extensions

## Description

Few extensions that were done as part of the research for the project

- Request Blocker
- Bookmarker
- Color Shop

feature/api testing phase:

- test_profiler
- Extension Coverage
- FlameGraph

## TODO
- disable other buttons when one is clicked (there are errors when you click multiple buttons quickly)
- maybe display a text like 'recording coverage...' or change button text to 'recording...'
- coverage table draws over flamegraph. flamegraph doesnt show up if you do coverage first
- test extensively because there's a lot of changes in this branch
